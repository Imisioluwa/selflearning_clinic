This self learning process embeddes three tasks, the first writes a function to find maximum and minimum number of an array
The second creates a fizzbuzz function to check divisibility by 3 and/or 5
The third checks if an array passed by an arguement is an arithmetic progression of Geometric progression.
Thank you.
